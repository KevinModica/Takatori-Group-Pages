## Primer

For functions of one variable, things are easy. We are normally taught to use the notation.

$$
F(x) = f(g(x)) \; \; \; \; \; \; F'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
$$

But to be more precise, what we are doing is.

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{df}{dg}\frac{dg}{dx}
$$
## Total Derivative

If $z = f(x,y)$ and $x=g(t),\; y=h(t)$. Then the total derivative $\frac{dz}{dt}$

$$
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}
$$

These are the same types of formulas you will use in thermo. $dU = TdS - PdV$ where $T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S})_{V}$  and $-P = \frac{\partial U}{\partial V})_S$ with the other variables held constant in the partial derivatives.


## Partial Derivative

Similarly, if $z = f(x,y)$ and $x=g(s,t)$, $y=h(s,t)$

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
$$
and
$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial s} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial s} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial s}
$$
