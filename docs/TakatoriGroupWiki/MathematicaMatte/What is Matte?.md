Matte is a mathematica plugin developed by Jonas Einarsson. The base version is available here https://github.com/jeinarsson/matte/ 

Matte allows one to perform tensor algebra and some basic tensor calculus in mathematica using Einstein notation. 

I have created a modified version that works in 2D. I have included the folder with both versions and example codes in a zip file.
